> Create a (reproducible) report

The best way to store your work in Radiant is use to use the _R > Report_ feature and save a state-file with all your results and settings. The report feature in Radiant should be used in conjunction with the <i title='Report results' class='fa fa-edit'></i> icons shown on the bottom of the (left) side bar on all analysis pages.

The editor shown on the left in _R > Report_ shows past commands in **code blocks**. These blocks can include R-code you typed or code generated by Radiant and added to the report after clicking the <i title='Report results' class='fa fa-edit'></i> icon shown on all analysis pages (generally on the bottom left of the screen). All code blocks start with ```` ```{r} ```` and are closed by ```` ``` ````

By default Radiant will add the code generated for the analysis you just completed to the bottom of the report. After clicking a <i title='Report results' class='fa fa-edit'></i> icon Radiant will, by default, switch to the _R > Report_. Then click inside the editor window on the left and scroll down to see the generated commands. However, you can choose to select `Manual paste` instead or `Auto paste` from the appropriate drop-down in the _R > Report_ tab. With `Manual paste` on the code is put into the clipboard when you click <i title='Report results' class='fa fa-edit'></i> and you can paste it where you want in the _R > Report_ editor window.

You can also choose not to switch tabs after clicking  a <i title='Report results' class='fa fa-edit'></i> icon by selecting `Don't switch tab` from the appropriate drop-down in the _R > Report_ tab.

If you started Radiant from Rstudio, you can even choose to have commands sent to an R-code or rmarkdown document open in Rstudio by selecting `To R` or `To Rmd` respectively instead of `Auto paste` or `Manual paste`.

You can add text or additional commands to create an rmarkdown document. An rmarkdown file (extension .Rmd) is a plain text file and can be opened in Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), Rstudio, Sublime Text, or any other text editor. Please do **not** use Word to edit rmarkdown files.

Using rmarkdown is extremely convenient because you can replicate your entire analysis very quickly without having to generate or type all commands again.

By clicking the `Knit report` button, the output from the analysis will be (re)created on the right of the _R > Report_ page. You can add text, bullets, headers, etc. around the code blocks to describe and explain the results using <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html" target="_blank">markdown</a>. To evaluate only a part of the report use the cursor to select a section and press CTRL-return (CMD-return on mac) to create the (partial) output.

To include output from Radiant in Word you can use screen-shots. For plots or tables you can also click a <i title='Download' class='fa fa-download'></i> icon to save the table or graph to disk. If Radiant was started from Rstudio any report developed in in _R > Report_ will be pasted into an open document in Rstudio. You can then use Rstudio to generate a Word, HTML, or pdf version of the report.

As an example you can copy-and-paste the text below into the editor in _R > Report_. You can also load an (R)markdown file into Radiant by clicking the `Choose File` button and selecting an .md or .Rmd file on your hard-drive. Press the `Knit report` button to see the output.

Finally, you can save the Rmd file open in the editor by pressing the `Save Rmd` button or save the generated output by pressing the `Save HTML` button. Note that Windows users will need to  install <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools33.exe" target="_blank">Rtools</a> for the `Save Rmd` feature to work.

<pre>## Sample report

This is an example of the type of report you can write in Radiant.

* You can create
* bullet lists

1. And numbered
2. lists

### Math

You can even include math if you want:

$$y_t = \\alpha + \\beta x_t + \\epsilon_t$$.

To show the output press the `Update` button.

### Documenting analysis results in Radiant

Below is some code created in Radiant that will generate regression output
for the _diamonds_ data. These are histograms and a scatterplot
/ heatmap of the price of diamonds versus carats. The colors in the plot
reflect the clarity of the diamond.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
result <- regression(dataset = 'diamonds', dep_var = 'price',
                     indep_var = 'carat')
summary(result)
plot(result, plots = 'hist')
```

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
visualize(dataset = 'diamonds', xvar = 'carat', yvar = 'price',
          type = 'scatter', color = 'clarity')
```
</pre>

The best way to save your analyses and settings is to save the `state` of the application to a file by clicking on the <i title='Save' class='fa fa-save'></i> icon in the navbar and then clicking on `Save state`. The state-file (extension rda) will contain (1) the data loaded in Radiant, (2) settings for the analyses you were working on, (3) and any reports or code from the R-menu. Save the state-file to your hard-disk and, when you are ready to continue, simply load it by selecting `state` from the `Load data of type` dropdown in the _Data > Manage_ tab and clicking the `Choose file` button.

If you are using Radiant for a class I suggest you use the report feature to complete assignments and cases. When you are done, generate an HTML file by clicking the `Save HTML` button. Submit this HTML file and your state-file.
